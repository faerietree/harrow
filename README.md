# Harrow

A tool for meadow care, e.g. it can be pulled across a field after manure has been spread if it is still too clumsy. The better it is distributed, the more plants benefit from the muck, and the less likely it is to mow into possible chunks later.

It also serves to spread earth hills created by mice (also - questionably - easing the life of those as they have an easier time getting material out).
